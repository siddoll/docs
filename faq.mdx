  <Accordion title="What is Typelense?">
    Typelense is an AI product photography platform for fashion & e-commerce. Upload garments, choose a model & pose, optionally a background—and get consistent, realistic product images for shop, social, and ads.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Who is Typelense for?">
    For D2C brands, marketplace sellers, agencies, and studios that need large volumes of images produced quickly, consistently, and cost-effectively—including campaign visuals, on-model, ghost-mannequin, flat-lay upgrades, and creative variations.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What does a typical generation look like?">
    1. **Upload garments** (top/bottom/set)
    2. **Select a model** (from gallery or your brand model)
    3. **Lock the pose** (pose remains 1:1 unchanged)
    4. **Choose background** (studio, location, gradient, or your own upload)
    5. **Render & review variants** (batch/series supported)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Will the pose really remain unchanged?">
    Yes. The selected pose is kept **1:1**. Only clothing and background change—ideal for catalog comparability.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Which file formats & quality should I upload?">
    **PNG** or **JPG**, **Webp**. Recommended: **clean cutouts** or clear flat-lay/on-hanger photos, one garment view per file, minimal wrinkles/reflections, no collages. Higher resolution ⇒ better edges and detail.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What aspect ratios & resolutions do I get?">
    Common ratios: **1:1**, **4:5**, **3:4**, **2:3**, **9:16**—ideal for shops, social, and ads. Optional **upscale** for high-resolution exports. (Project-wide defaults are configurable.)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How accurate is garment fidelity (logos, patterns, fabrics)?">
    Very high—especially with clean input photos. Best results with even lighting, visible texture, and minimal compression artifacts. Extremely fine patterns (moiré), highly reflective, or transparent fabrics are inherently more challenging.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Is underwear/swimwear allowed?">
    Yes, **provided it's non-explicit** and focused on product depiction. **No minors**, no sexualized content. We reserve the right to moderate violations of our guidelines.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What about watermarks/AI markings?">
    Typelense **does not add visible watermarks**. Some underlying models may embed **invisible watermarks/signatures**. We **do not remove or tamper with** such signals.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Who owns the generated images?">
    Generally, **you do**, **provided** you hold the rights to the inputs (garments, references, logos). You receive **commercial usage rights** to the generated assets. Please also respect the license terms of any model/asset sources used in your project.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Where is data processed & how long is it retained?">
    Stored only as long as needed for the service (render, review, re-use) or per contract. You can **delete** assets/jobs at any time. **Enterprise**: options for **shortened retention**, customer-specific **data residency**, and **DPA/AVV**.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How are credits/pricing calculated?">
    Billed **per generation/variant** (and optional upscale). Failed jobs are **not** charged. Volume plans and enterprise packages available.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What can I do if quality/fit isn't right?">
    - **Improve input:** higher resolution, one garment per file, clean edges
    - **Check pose:** avoid heavy self-occlusions; keep pose 1:1 fixed
    - **Simplify background:** use studio/gradient for catalog sets
    - **More variants:** 4–8 variants can improve hit rate

    If you're stuck, send us the **job ID & example**—we'll debug it with you.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I ensure series consistency (catalog look)?">
    Define **project presets** (pose set, lighting, background, ratio) and use **uniform inputs** per category. Repeat presets across all products in the series.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Which compliance topics do you cover (EU AI Act, data protection)?">
    We operate with **privacy-by-design**, provide **DPA/AVV**, role-based access control, and content moderation. **Enterprise**: additional controls (e.g., audit logs, data residency, pen-tests) on request.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do you offer enterprise features (SLA, SSO, roles)?">
    Yes. **SLA**, **SSO (SAML/OIDC)**, fine-grained **roles/permissions**, dedicated environments, custom quotas, and support channels are available.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I reach support?">
    In-product via **Help → Support**, by email at <a href="mailto:hello@typelense.io">hello@typelense.io</a> or via a shared Slack channel (Enterprise). Please include your **project/job ID**.
